<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>

<p>
  I am Juan Pablo Rocha Rincón, a Systems and Technology Engineer, graduated from the Universidad del Valle de México with a GPA of 9.74. 
  My education has equipped me with both technical and leadership skills, which I have been able to develop throughout my academic and 
  professional journey. One of the most significant projects I completed during my studies was the development of a calendar application 
  using Swift UI. This project was a crucial part of my final grade and involved creating a real-time scheduling tool for professors and 
  students, allowing them to book appointments and check available slots efficiently. This hands-on experience enabled me to apply my 
  programming and software development knowledge in a practical setting.

  My professional path has been defined by my entrepreneurial drive. In July 2022, I founded Capture Your Dreams, a business where I have 
  been responsible for managing everything from creating digital marketing strategies to coordinating events and managing supplier relationships. 
  This venture has allowed me to focus on designing unique and personalized experiences for clients, ensuring that we deliver high-quality 
  products while continuously optimizing operational processes to enhance efficiency and customer service.

  catering services, establishing corporate partnerships, supervising and training staff, and boosting sales through effective marketing strategies. 
  Efficient inventory management and a streamlined billing process were also central to my role, which enabled me to improve the overall operation of the business.

  investments, and retirement funds, achieving a 25% increase in AFORE transfers in my first year and 36% in the second year. I also worked as a sales consultant 
  at Gayosso, LoJack, and Grupo de Administración de Bienes y Servicios, where I not only achieved consistent sales results but also took on leadership roles, 
  managing sales teams and providing continuous training for advisors. At Grupo de Administración de Bienes y Servicios, I handled key accounts like Correos de 
  México and Gas Natural, achieving a 35% increase in sales for Gas Natural in 2013.
